Hey there, welcome to our HTML open source project. Redesign the HTML landing page and have fun doing it. Happy coding :)

# Contribution Guide

- Fork the repository, clone and make sure that you are not working on the `MASTER BRANCH' repository!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username-here}/HTML-project.git
```

```bash
cd HTML-project
```

```bash
git checkout -b {name-of-the-branch-here}
```

```bash
git checkout -b {name-of-the-branch-here}
```

- Add a stream so you can sync your clone with the original repository (get the latest updates)

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/HTML-project.git
```

```bash
git pull upstream master
```

- Make your contribution too :)
